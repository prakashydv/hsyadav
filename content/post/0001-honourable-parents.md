It has been often reported  that second generation of those who migrated from village is generally  less  hard working, less successful, more dependent , easy going and easily fall into depression in tough circumstances when life passes  through rough waters. The reasons for same are simple. Parents think that their children should not pass through the same ordeal which they have gone through. Here is the catch. We forget that that ordeal is the main reason why the parents or the first generation was made more mature and strong to sustain any kind of ups and downs in life. That was the real diet for their  success .

Now these first generation parents withdraw that diet  from their children. They do not allow their children to pass through the rigours of life. They do not allow their children to buy milk from milk booth and ask and count the change, they do not allow their children to fight and again settle their grievances  with children of neighbourhood, they do not allow children to sweep their floor and clean the surrounding , they outsource to Bai .They do not allow them to soak in the rain and feel the bliss.They do not allow them to attempt and struggle out on a math's  equation or geometry  and come out with their own solution, they help children with Googling or Tutoring . They do not allow them to fail and fall. They give message that he or she  is only to be  successful . Failure is bad. It is often seen that those boys or girls  who never failed , are most likely to go under depression when faced with  rough weather in adult life.

So the real education , if parents can give , is to  allow their sons and daughters to leave them free to do their duties , take daily decision as is expected from them, allow them to do manual  labour to understand the  dignity of it.Allow them to help the old , sick and poor  to understand the compassion . Allow them to make their own bed, wash their garments , polish their shoes , let them  be spoiled   in mud hill, let them question and explore the wildest and most foolish thing. Good maths may earn them  only livelihood but spirit of compassion, ownership, sense of enquiry and sports will earn them art of living.
