It appears slightly bizarre statement. I would explain. Shudra , to me , is  not the one who is born in a particular caste but the one who is made to believe that he can not think big, he can not aspire to break the shackle of poverty, he is made to believe that he is born slow and dumb, he is made to believe that he can not visit sacred places because he is fated so on the day he was born , he is made to believe that he has no freedom to dine with high and mighty.Shudras  are in every caste. They may be political capital for a politician but they are root cause of the poor economics of a society. They may have brilliant mind , which I consider the asset to society. They may work longer hours, they may be more obedient . But nation is unable to tap their potential because they have been made to believe by society that they are of less  worth .

The people who ruled our country hardly utter the word sir but we the once ruled , say number of sirs in a sentence .If I decide today not to do so, it is not possible because I have been brainwashed since my birth. It is double whammy . The people who consider themselves the gifted or ordained to rule or who are called Sirs,they suffer another kind of slavery. They think what they say is right. They suffer from ego which blunts their potential of inclusive  thinking.

Society suffers doubly by Shudras and non shudras both. It is all mental conditioning. This conditioning is further reinforced by every ruling class by giving material  freebies like free ration, reservation etc . It is perpetuating the Shudra thinking . It is restricting the  take off for higher altitude.

Country is not using 60-70% of its dormant  asset. The asset of thinking big without bias. Any country is poor because it has not used it's store house of 'thinking big' capital.

By allowing Private schools and coaching classes, depriving quality education to deprived people thereby disallowing them to compete on equal level . We indirectly are disallowing them  to rise to higher place to think big and contribute to nation . We have used axe on our own feet.We have harmed ourselves. We are poor inspite  of huge material  resources because we have clipped the wings of Shudra class.

It can be done by giving quality education to all and providing more opportunity. We must strengthen our education system so that the best brain is used to train our sons and daughters, train them to think big. Scrap all coaching classes. Make uniform standard for imparting education to all. Create more opportunities than giving freebie in any form. But most important of all de-clog the mind from mental  slavery and put wings of fire. Only then we will be on top of ladder as a nation.
