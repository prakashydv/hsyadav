If we take age of earth  as one year, human being  has appeared here only 15 minutes ago. In such a brief period of existence on earth , human being   has made itself redundant, unwanted . If we look closely, man is dependent on all other species for his survival but none of the species is dependent on man.Man has created umpteen number of products by utilising huge energy usurping from Nature and trying hard to sustain it by fighting against Nature.Nature can  return to its natural state only when it has eliminated  human being. So,Nature is hastening the elimination of human being  and man is helping the elimination  process, albeit unknowingly .

Perhaps human is a tiny dot among the millions of species on earth  .Nature will gobble up human species  very fast while other creatures who were millions of year before humans came,  will continue to live  millions of years after humans have disappeared from earth.
So, question is what should we do? Nothing. Just see the drama being unfolded and enjoy.  Just  witness the elimination process and chant  "Soham"( I am that).
