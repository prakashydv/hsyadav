When you are at inner  peace , the deity in the front appears to be happy with you and appears to be blessing. When your are in turmoil, same deity appears to be a angry with you. In fact Deity is nothing to do with your peace or turmoil, neither happy or angry. The entire cosmos is within us and entire operations of peace or turmoil, happiness or being angry is happening inside  us.
Statue of deity is mere mirror which reflects your condition on your face.
