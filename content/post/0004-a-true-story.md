I have a true story to tell:
Every person has something to offer:

Nearly after 2 years in Junior scale, I was promoted and posted in 1990 as Executive Engineer/Bridge Workshop, Gorakhpur Cantt. By tradition, young officers were rarely posted as XEN/BWS and it was not a popular post for them, though some excellent IRSE officers had held that post before me. Few people were heard saying about me  that phans gaye (trapped). However, I started without prejudice to post or people.  After few months of working, I found that fabrication work was frequently stopped on pretext that one or the other material is not in store. Shortage of material included right from marking chalk to structural steel. Workers and supervisors lacked motivation. They used to come to workshop not before 8:00 hrs  whereas workshop opened at 06: 30 hrs. With frequent interaction, I found that if material is supplied in time and employees start work timely, production can be improved. Major constraint was structural steel. I collected all the indents placed and PO issued thus far by Stores Deptt. I noted that large number of Purchase Orders were pending on Durgapur Steel Plant for many years. I was told that some of the steel sections are not being fabricated by DSP for one reason or the other.

There was one Employee union leader by name Prem Chand. He was tall, had impressive beard and always in white Kurta/Pajama like any other political leaders at that time. He was not obstructive but always used to bring one issue or the other. There were many other ghost employees and some of them notorious who hardly attended to work. Prem Chand was at least attending the work regularly. Although he did not work much but I was very impressed by his convincing power.

Since steel supply was the main problem in fabrication, instead of writing letter, I decided to visit DSP myself to discuss with DSP officials. I decided to take  Prem Chand with me rather than any supervisor or officer. I visited the DSP plant and stayed there for 2 days. I moved around each nook and corner of plant with the plant officers and found that those sizes of structural steel which are urgently required by my work shop are available in plenty here. Earlier, I had been told that the same is not being produced by plant. I was surprised but had solace that material is available. Only a close chasing was required. The officers from DSP too were pleasantly surprised and told me that no officer of my level from Government department comes to plant for material chasing. They were apologetic for not supplying steel timely against the pending POs.I was told un-officially by my people that preference for steel supply was given by DSP to private firms over Government orders for reason best known to them.

I asked Prem Chand to camp at DSP till material is despatched. Prem Chand had charming personality and always in good attire. He was introduced to all plant officials and they were told that Prem Chand will liaison on my behalf at plant. Prem Chand  was very happy and motivated to stay at DSP . Prem Chand might  not be  good at skilled work but was very good at conversation and convincing  the person on opposite side without being rude. He stayed there for days and ensured that material was  despatched. After few months, work shop started getting steel in open wagons in quick succession. BWS started getting steel in so much quantity that was never heard of in BWS. Steel against all pending POs were soon supplied and BWS compound was full to brim. Our people were highly motivated to see so much steel in work shop. The end result was that Annual Fabrication progress reached to 1640 MT which hardly had gone  beyond 1100-1200 MT in previous years. It was all time highest production of Work shop at that time .

Prem Chand often seen as non working employee , and being union leader, always cribbed against one issue or the other, was the real savior who was on auto mode in  chasing, cajoling  and even giving  mild threat to Plant officials for quick supply.

BWS had received so much steel that it continued for many years. I am happy that those who worked with me in BWS (1990-1993) still remember those days fondly and with great pride.

Kudos to Prem Chand who gave me confidence that no one is useless. Everyone has something to offer.

Jai Hind!
