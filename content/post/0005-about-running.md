Running is most primitive and natural  to humans. However, majority of humans do not know how to run. It is much easier than walking and most beneficial. One can run even at walking speed and it accentuates the benefit. Any one of any age can run. One should know the technique. Letâ€™s learn the correct method and enjoy the running.
Many people have wrong notion that running damages the knee. It is the bad technique of running which damages the knee. If you see the animals closely, I doubt they they have knee problem though they keep running  through out their life. If you want to know further , just see the slow motion video of any running animal  how they place their foot on ground while running. They place it softly and at a particular angle. Body load is transferred through muscles around knee, bypassing the knee cap. Muscles get strengthened. If running is done correctly, it rather strengthens the knee muscles like in cycling or swimming.
Running stimulates many glands which secrete useful positive hormones elevating good mood, better concentration, better cardio. Even if done for 20-30 min daily, it is like a medicine.
Many people have wrong notion that while running they have to be faster. It is not. Speed is not of great significance. It is different for different person. Best speed for any one is that at which  one can talk to fellow jogger without becoming out of breath while running.
Have good day, Enjoy running, be on high always.
