Navratra for non believers :
Every civilisation has tried to explore and understand the Nature and relate ourselves with it. Indus civilisation have simplified entire being into two i.e.  Shiva (unmanifested consciousness, can not be seen but governs entire creation ) and Shakti (manifested , which we can see, which creates, sustains and dissolves the creation ). In Chinese civilisation they are   Tao and Teh. In Christianity it is Consciousness  and Virgin Mary (Supreme mother). One need not be believer to realise this. Even non believer can realise by analysis and inquiry. Shiva and Shakti are ultimately one and the  same, merging  at the end. None exists without other.They are not male or Female per se . They are simply  symbol of Cosmic energy (manifested and un manifested)  pervading every where in the Universe.

To realise the presence and significance of Mother nature (Manifested Shakti), Navaratra period is good time. Some people do puja, some do fasting , some do japa, some do mantra chanting (Path). Actually these are different methods to feel and realise that we are connected to higher cosmic energy.
Fasting is one of the best method to cleanse not only  toxins stored in the body but tune antenna  physically and mentally to feel the cosmic energy.

Fasting can be  half day , full day or even one meal fast. It can be liquid fast, fruit fast as per choice.It prepares the body (manifested part of Shakti) to connect the unmanifested Shiva (Consciousness). What we know is limited by what we see , hear, touch, smell. All these have limited band in which we can experience  it. Beyond that band there are several happenings and existence which we are unable  to know in normal sense. There are several creatures and now modern instruments  which  have access to those band of experience.

So, doing fasting even  partially  provides method to reduce weight, feel good, remain peaceful and blissful.Simple easily digestible food during Navratra  prepares  peaceful mind and body to  receive cosmic energy .
It rejuvenates the body and nourishes  the  mind to feel the  Consciousness supreme.
